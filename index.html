    <p>Q1 – Implications of the scientific issue (fusion).ARTICLE 2 – Philip Ball, What Is the Future of Fusion Energy?
SOCIAL – Advantages=Future source of large amounts of clean energy for an “energy hungry planet”. Could support rising demand in developing countries in second half of the century. Lower risk of catastrophic accidents than fission → safer for the public. If it replaces fossil fuels, reduces air pollution and associated health problems.
SOCIAL – Disadvantages=Won’t arrive in time to stop near term climate change → society still faces severe climate impacts. Risk of false hope – public/politicians might delay action on existing solutions. Big projects (ITER etc.) tend to be in rich countries → could widen global inequality in access to cheap energy.
ETHICAL – Advantages=Long term: low carbon energy that protects future generations from fossil fuel damage. Much less long lived radioactive waste than fission; lower meltdown risk → ethically preferable to current nuclear.
ETHICAL – Disadvantages=Huge amounts of public money spent on technology that cannot help the urgent climate crisis now. Questions of fairness: which nations/companies will control fusion plants and profit from them?
ENVIRONMENTAL – Advantages=Near zero direct CO₂ emissions during operation. Produces far less and shorter lived radioactive waste than fission. No runaway chain reaction, so meltdowns/explosions like Chernobyl not expected.
ENVIRONMENTAL – Disadvantages=Cannot prevent mid century climate tipping points because it arrives too late. Construction of gigantic reactors (steel, concrete, supply chains) has its own environmental footprint. Neutron bombardment damages reactor walls → they become radioactive waste that must be managed.
ECONOMIC – Advantages=Could eventually provide large scale “plug in” replacement for existing coal/fission plants using the same grid infrastructure. Large projects (ITER, STEP, DEMO, start ups) create high skill jobs and new industries.
ECONOMIC – Disadvantages=ITER cost ≈ $45 billion and is years behind schedule → very expensive and risky investments. No existing fusion power plant design; commercial power likely only after 2040–2060. Uncertainty over tritium breeding and materials performance → big financial risk that current R&D never pays off.
ARTICLE 3 – Dietz et al., Will Fusion Energy Help Decarbonise the Power System?
SOCIAL – Advantages=Aims to support a reliable zero carbon grid as electricity demand triples by 2050. Dispatchable (on demand) clean power helps avoid blackouts like Europe’s 2019 shortages. Can support electrification of transport/industry, improving quality of life without higher emissions.
SOCIAL – Disadvantages=High capital costs could increase electricity prices if costs passed to consumers. May concentrate energy control in countries/companies that can afford fusion plants.
ETHICAL – Advantages=Helps meet Paris Agreement goals, reducing harm from climate change. Dispatchable zero carbon generation is presented as a responsible way to stabilise the grid and protect vulnerable populations.
ETHICAL – Disadvantages=Opportunity cost: billions invested in fusion might instead fund cheaper renewables or adaptation in poorer regions. Article is written by a management consultancy – potential ethical question about promoting technologies that could benefit their clients.
ENVIRONMENTAL – Advantages=Zero operational CO₂ emissions; fusion fuel is abundant and low carbon. No long lived high level waste, no meltdown risk → less environmental hazard than fission. Could reduce need for backup fossil fuel plants that currently stabilise wind/solar grids.
ENVIRONMENTAL – Disadvantages=Still some radioactive activation of reactor materials; need safe decommissioning. If fusion is over hyped and under delivers, delayed decarbonisation could worsen environmental damage.
ECONOMIC – Advantages=McKinsey modelling: if capital costs are low enough, fusion could be the most cost effective and dominant dispatchable clean energy source for Europe by 2050. Dispatchable zero carbon sources (fusion, advanced nuclear) are shown as most “valuable” in techno economic grid models. Huge growth in private investment (nearly tripled in 2021) → new jobs, innovation, and industrial sector.
ECONOMIC – Disadvantages=Capital intensive; economic success depends on hitting aggressive cost and performance targets. Competes with rapidly falling costs of wind, solar and batteries – risk of stranded assets if fusion is too expensive. Grid and regulatory systems must adapt; otherwise economic benefits may not be realised.

6.	Miklós Dietz, Bill Lacivita, Amélie Lefebvre, Geoff Olynyk – Article 3 authors (McKinsey energy experts)
•	Influence: create techno economic models showing possible role of fusion; their work can steer investment and strategy in the power sector.
Q3 – Validity of judgements in Article 3 (Dietz et al.)
•	Reliability: results/data are repeatable; others can reproduce them; clear patterns in data; supported by other studies.
•	Validity: study/article actually measures and discusses what it claims to; conclusions follow from evidence; consistent with other credible work; peer reviewed or expert reviewed.
•	Bias: one sided or overly optimistic/pessimistic; conflicts of interest; selective use of data or emotional language.
Evidence used in Article 3. Data & references (reliability)
•	Uses widely accepted facts:
•	Power sector ≈30% of global CO₂ emissions.
•	Need for net zero by 2050 (Paris Agreement).
•	Growth of renewables and demand (cites McKinsey Global Energy Perspective 2022 and other numbered references [1]–[9]).
•	Includes figures and models:
•	Figure 1: scenario where fusion could become the most cost effective dispatchable energy source for Europe by 2050 at certain capital costs.
•	Figure 2: number of private fusion companies and cumulative private investment over time.
•	These are based on techno economic modelling, not direct experimental data → reasonable but inherently uncertain.
Interpretation / analysis (validity)
•	Correctly explains:
•	Fusion vs fission vs renewables (dispatchable vs non dispatchable).
•	Need for flexible zero carbon grid to back up wind/solar.
•	Links modelling results to conclusions: if fusion can be built cheaply enough, it could take a large share of dispatchable generation.
•	Acknowledges that fusion is still experimental and that other technologies (wind, solar, batteries, geothermal, tidal) are also important.
•	However:
•	Assumes certain future capital costs for fusion that are speculative.
•	Assumes political and regulatory conditions that may or may not happen.
•	No real world commercial fusion plant exists yet to validate these cost assumptions.
Bias / optimism
•	Written by McKinsey, a consultancy that advises large energy clients → potential commercial bias towards big infrastructure solutions like fusion.
•	Tone is cautiously optimistic:
•	Highlights advantages and recent progress (technology, funding).
•	Presents fusion as “potentially” key, not guaranteed, but overall positive framing.
•	Could understate possible negative aspects:
•	Technological failure risk.
•	Competition from ever cheaper wind/solar + storage.
•	Social/ethical debate is not deeply discussed.
Use of other sources
•	References numbered [1]–[9], including:
•	Paris Agreement targets.
•	McKinsey’s own Global Energy Perspective.
•	Energy shortage events in Europe.
•	Examples of fusion companies and investments.
•	Many references are recent (around 2022) and from recognised organisations → increases validity.
•	Some references are McKinsey’s own work → self referencing; good for consistency but less independent.
Overall judgement you can make in the exam
•	The article’s judgements are partly valid:
•	Based on accepted climate science and reasonable grid modelling techniques.
•	Supported by current investment data and recent technological progress.
•	Reliability is moderate:
•	Clear figures and sources, but reliant on models of a future technology that does not yet exist commercially.
•	There is some bias and optimism:
•	Written by a consultancy with potential vested interests; tends to highlight fusion’s potential economic benefits and downplay competing zero carbon options.
•	Conclusion you can write:
•	“Overall, the judgements are cautiously valid but depend heavily on optimistic assumptions about future fusion costs and successful technological development, so they should be treated as informed forecasts rather than proven facts.”
Q4 – Further development / research areas. Technical / scientific
•	Demonstrate continuous net energy gain in reactors, not just single shot experiments like NIF.
•	Improve materials that can withstand high neutron bombardment and heat without rapid damage.
•	Develop reliable tritium breeding and fuel cycle systems at power plant scale.
•	Compare and optimise different reactor designs: tokamaks (ITER, STEP, DEMO), spherical tokamaks, inertial confinement, and alternative fuel cycles (e.g. hydrogen–boron).
Engineering / economic
•	Reduce capital costs of fusion plants so they can compete with wind, solar and advanced nuclear (as assumed in McKinsey’s models).
•	Study grid integration: how fusion plants would work alongside large amounts of wind/solar; best mix of dispatchable vs variable resources.
•	Improve techno economic models using updated costs and realistic construction times for fusion and competing technologies.
Social / policy
•	Research public acceptance of fusion compared with fission and other energy sources.
•	Develop suitable regulatory frameworks and safety standards for commercial fusion plants.
•	Study global equity: how developing countries could gain access to fusion technology, not just rich nations.</p>
